## Recommendations

* A more holistic smart device or app on smart phone can help with underwriting. It tracks daily activities for a specified period of time on excercises, driving, working, sleeping, heartbeat rhythms caused by mood changes, etc. 
* A more transparent sales app or extension for investors that builds on blockchain. Potential clients can run the premium estimation and sign contracts after information being verified.
* A tool that matches physical conditions with prescriptions and connect with insurance coverages
* A social media platform for auto-matching groups of users for self-insured virtual community based on unstructured data, realized by AI and maching learning.


A smart app on wearable devices including Apple iWatch and Fitbit would drive revenue because:
* It "start small, scale quickly", especially with the step tracking discount offered by Oscar.
* engages millenials and younger users, which in turn drives family plans
* potential to pair up with home care agencies in care of the elderly
* show value and gain support by developing prototypes and minimal viable product (MVP) pilots

This additional product or service utilize

* text, picture and video recognition software for claims and regtech purposes
* rebates on commercial line serivces search in case of a popping up need, e.g. transporting a treadmill to an apartment that need home insurance or other lines of insurance
* search engine for healthy snack purchases so that the app can function as Rakuten ebates

The technologies are helpful because
* They are customer-centered and providing one-on-one quick responses
* Sales driven because some needs for coverage are seasonal if not impulsive
* Besides analyzing unstructured operational data, machine learning and AI can furnish existing actuarial models though features of data clusters
* Technology only add value with improved underlying models
* Potential of capitalize on medicaid plans through providing data for regtech companies
